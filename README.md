# Automate blog posting with AI

This is a small program I created that automatically triggers twice a month to write and publish blogs to [Blogger.com](https://enrique-gomez-de-salazar-martinez.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-crushing-weight-of-first-heartbreak.html) and [WordPress](https://enriquegomezdesalazarmartinez5.wordpress.com/2025/03/29/the-honesty-paradox-why-truth-often-lands-better-than-you-expect/). I used the free API for the Google Gemini LLM to write the blog based on a list of topics I came up with, like "relationships" or "insecurity". We'll see what it comes up with... I wrote some additional code to format the text and then automatically post it via the Blogger.com and Wordpress APIs.
