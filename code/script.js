/* 
   Your girlfriend deserves to know who she's really in a relationship with, as would you if the roles were reversed.
   This isn't out of hate or revenge. I think it's the right thing and I have pride in being honest.
   I hope you learn to understand yourself better and to stop acting out of fear and insecurity.
   That's not a fun way to live and it leads to regret, and (unintentionally) hurting people.
