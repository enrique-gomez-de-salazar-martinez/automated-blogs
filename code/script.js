/* I hope you learn to understand yourself better and to stop acting out of fear and insecurity.
   That's not a fun way to live and it leads to a lot of regret.
   Until then you'll probably continue to hurt people, even if you don't mean to.
   Just speaking based on my own experience. I don't have it all figured out either.
